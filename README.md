## What be it?

**togo** is a collection of libraries with simplicity and rapid iteration at
heart.

## Components

### Library: core

Basic support library. All other libraries depend on it.

Dependencies:

1. [All the Maths‽](https://github.com/komiga/am) (HEAD)

### Library: image

Imaging library.

### Library: window

Windowing library.

Dependencies:

1. [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/index.html) >= **1.13.0**
2. Backend (one of):
  1. [SDL](http://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) >= **2.0.3** (*OpenGL, raster*)
  2. [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/download.html) >= **3.0.4** (*OpenGL*)
3. With raster backends:
  1. `lib/image`

### Library: game

Game engine.

This library takes significant inspiration from bitsquid
(now [Stingray](http://stingrayengine.com/)), who have
[written about](https://github.com/niklasfrykholm/blog) their design in great
detail.

Dependencies:

1. `lib/window` (requires OpenGL backend)

### Tool: res_build

Resource package compiler for the game library. Interface is available as a
static library for extension and automation.

Dependencies:

1. `lib/game`

## Platforms

togo is developed under Linux and currently only supports Linux. Its primary
interface implementations utilize POSIX and the C Standard Library (by way of
the C++ Standard Library, of which only little is used).

## Building

togo libraries are compiled static libraries (by default).

All features support Clang 3.5+ with libc++ (roughly at SVN head) on
Ubuntu 14.04 x86_64. GCC and libstdc++ might work, but they are untested.

Interface headers are generated by [igen](https://github.com/komiga/igen),
which requires Python 2.x, Mako, and cindex.py (libclang wrapper).

Inclusions are sorted with [include_sort](https://github.com/komiga/include_sort)
(see `scripts/include_sort`), but it is not required to build togo.

See `dep/README.md` for dependency setup. Components can then be built using
my [standard project protocol](http://komiga.com/pp-cpp).

The only difference from the project protocol is `scripts/premake` in place of
premake, which enforces recipe order to allow the use of GNU make's `--jobs`.

Build configuration:

* `--togo-test`

  Enable test mode.

* `--togo-window-backend=sdl | glfw`

  Set window backend. See [lib/window](#library-window) above for the
  dependencies required.
