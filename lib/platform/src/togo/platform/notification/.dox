@details

A Notification object can be modified without affecting what the user sees, as
its state is only used when notification::post() is called.

notification::init() must be called before creating any notifications or using
any other part of the notification interface.

notification::poll() must be called for callbacks to be processed and
notification::is_active() to be valid.

Some backends don't support all of the features of the interface. They are as
follows:

@par libnotify (Linux)

libnotify is particularly poorly implemented by notification servers, but it is
the only widespread system for Linux.

- The @c NotificationClosed signal may be under- or un-implemented, which makes
notification::is_active() nearly useless for determining status. e.g.,

	- AwesomeWM (@<4.x)
	- NotifyOSD (only on notification::dismiss())

- When @c lifetime is @c 0, notification may not be treated as a notification.
e.g.,

	- NotifyOSD (opens a prompt)

- Lifetime is otherwise ignored. e.g.,

	- NotifyOSD (uses its own lifetime)
