Due to the behavior of some graphics backends, there should only be
one InputBuffer in use. Events for displays that have not been added
to the display system will be discarded.

The SDL graphics backend may report events to the wrong display due to
SDL implementation quirks. Keyboard events that do not have a valid
windowID will be reported as having come from the first display in the
input buffer (hopefully the primary display).
